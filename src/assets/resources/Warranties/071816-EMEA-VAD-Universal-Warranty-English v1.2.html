<br>
If you do not have internet access or the Apple Product is still not functioning properly after making use of these resources, please contact an Apple representative or, if applicable, an Apple owned retail store (“Apple Retail”) or an AASP, and they will help determine whether your Apple Product requires service and, if it does, will inform you in which of the warranty service options set out below Apple will provide it. <br>
<br>
Before receiving warranty service, Apple or its agents may require that you furnish proof of purchase details, respond to questions designed to assist with diagnosing potential issues and follow Apple's procedures for obtaining warranty service, such as following instructions for packing and shipping Apple Products when receiving Mail-in service as described below. <br>
<br>
<span class="s1"><b>WARRANTY SERVICE OPTIONS<br>
<br>
</b></span>Apple will provide warranty service through one of the following options:<br>
<br>
<b>(i) Carry-in service.</b> Apple may request that you return your Apple Product to an Apple Retail or AASP location offering carry-in service. Your Apple Product may be sent to an Apple Repair Service (“ARS”) location to be serviced. Once you are notified that service is complete, you will retrieve the Apple Product from the Apple Retail or AASP location without delay unless Apple notifies you that the Apple Product will be sent directly to your location from the ARS location.<br>
<br>
<b>(ii) Mail-in service.</b> If Apple elects to provide service through its mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills and if applicable, packaging material and instructions on how to properly pack and address your Apple product, so that you may ship your Apple Product to an ARS or AASP location. Once service is complete, the ARS or AASP location will return the Apple Product to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if all instructions regarding the method of packaging and shipping the Apple Product are followed.<br>
<br>
<b>(iii) Do-it-yourself (“DIY”) service.</b> Under DIY service Apple will provide you with a replacement product or easily replaceable parts or accessories of a product, such as a mouse or keyboard, which can be replaced without using any tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">Note:</span> Apple is not responsible for any labour costs you incur relating to DIY service. Should you require further assistance with the replacement, contact Apple at the telephone number listed below, or visit an Apple Retail or AASP location. If Apple elects to provide service through DIY service, the following process will apply: <br>
<br>
(a) Service where Apple requires return of the replaced product, part or accessory: Apple may require a credit card authorization as security for the retail price of the replacement product, part or accessory and applicable shipping costs. Apple will ship a replacement product, part or accessory to you with instructions for replacement, if applicable, and any requirements for the return of the replaced product or part. If you follow the instructions, Apple will cancel the credit card authorization, so you will not be charged for the product or part and shipping to and from your location. If you fail to return the replaced product, part or accessory as instructed or return a replaced product, part or accessory that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge your credit card for the authorized amount. If you are unable to provide credit card authorization, the service may not be available to you and Apple will offer alternative arrangements for service.<br>
<br>
(b) Service where Apple does not require return of the replaced product, part or accessory: Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product, part or accessory accompanied by instructions on installation, if applicable, and any requirements for the disposal of the replaced product, part or accessory. <br>
