Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of certain Services may require an Apple ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an iTunes Store account, Apple ID, Game Center account, iCloud account or other Apple account, you agree to the applicable terms of service for that account, such as the latest iTunes Store Terms and Conditions or Game Center Terms and Conditions, which you may access and review at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/ww/">http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/ww/</a>, or the iCloud Terms and Conditions which can be found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/ww/">http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/ww/</a>, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">B.

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">C. <span class="s1">Maps.</span> The maps service and features of the Apple Software (“Maps”), including map data coverage, may vary by region. When you use any location-based features within Maps, such as traffic and local search, various location-related and usage information may be sent to Apple, including the real-time geographic location of your computer, in order to process your request and help improve Maps. Such location and usage data is collected by Apple in a form that does not personally identify you. <b>By using Maps, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information to provide and improve the Maps features and service, and other Apple products and services.</b> Apple may also provide such information, in either an aggregated or non personally identifiable form, to its partners and licensees to help improve their map and location-based products and services. You may disable the location-based functionality of Maps by going to the Location Services setting on your computer and turning off the individual location setting for Maps. Certain Maps features will, however, be unavailable if you disable the Location Services setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">D. You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Services at your sole risk and that Apple shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">E. Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Apple is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Apple, its officers, affiliates and subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">F. Neither Apple nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services. Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data provided by any Services, including the Apple Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and/or planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions, and geopolitical events. For your safety, always pay attention to posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and note that walking directions may not include sidewalks or pedestrian paths.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">G. To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Apple, the site owner and/or their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Apple. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity.

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">H. In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed, linked to or displayed through the Apple Software are not available in all languages or in all countries. Apple makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>6. Termination.</b> This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License.

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>------------------------</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">These Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions (the “Supplemental Terms”) supplement the Software License Agreement for macOS (the “License”); both the terms of the License and these Supplemental Terms govern your use of the Apple Pay feature, which shall be deemed a “Service” under the License.  Capitalized terms used in these Supplemental Terms have the meanings set forth in the License.</p>
<p class="p1"><br>
<b>1 Overview and Use Restrictions</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay allows you to store virtual representations of credit, debit and prepaid cards, including store credit, debit and prepaid cards, which are supported by the Apple Pay feature (“Supported Cards”) and use supported Macs to initiate or make payments within websites.  The Apple Pay features of the Apple Software may only be available in select regions, with select card issuers, and with select merchants. Features may vary by region, issuer, and merchant.  Supported Cards may change from time to time.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay is intended for your personal use and you may only provision your own Supported Cards.  If you are provisioning a supported corporate card, you represent that you are doing so with the authorization of your employer and you are authorized to bind your employer to these terms of use and all transactions effected by use of this feature.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You agree not to use Apple Pay for illegal or fraudulent purposes, or any other purposes that are prohibited by the License and these Supplemental Terms.  You further agree to use Apple Pay in accordance with applicable law and regulation.  You agree not to interfere with or disrupt the Apple Pay service (including accessing the service through any automated means), or any servers or networks connected to the service, or any policies, requirements or regulations of networks connected to the service (including any unauthorized access to, use or monitoring of data or traffic thereon).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>2 Use on Macs</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><br>
</b>You can use Apple Pay on supported Macs to initiate payments on websites accessed through Safari.  This feature requires you to have a Supported Card that has been provisioned to a supported iOS device or Apple Watch (“Supported Devices”).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you check out from a website using Apple Pay, you will be required to authorize the transaction using a Supported Device.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to the terms set forth in these Supplemental Terms, your use of Apple Pay to initiate payments on websites access through Safari is subject to the Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions applicable to your Supported Devices, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference and which can be accessed by going to:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Settings &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Legal &gt; License from your iOS device, or About &gt; Legal &gt; License from the Watch app on a paired iOS device.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Supported Devices may change from time to time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, you can set up Apple Pay by provisioning Supported Cards and using Apple Pay to make payments on websites accessed through Safari.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to use Apple Pay on these Macs, you must have Supported Cards that are associated with an active iCloud account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apple Pay is available only to individuals aged 13 years or older, and may be subject to additional age-based restrictions imposed by iCloud or the relevant card issuer of your Supported Cards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>3 Apple’s Relationship With You</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><br>
</b>Apple does not process payments, or have any other control over payments, returns, refunds, rewards, value, discounts or other commerce activity that may arise out of your use of this feature.  The terms of cardholder agreements you may have in place with your card issuer will continue to govern your use of your Supported Cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Similarly, your purchase of any goods or services using the Apple Pay feature will be subject to the merchant’s terms and conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing in the License or these Supplemental Terms modifies the terms of any cardholder or merchant agreement, and such terms will govern your use of the applicable Supported Card and its virtual representation on your supported Mac.</p>
<p class="p1"><br>
You agree that Apple is not a party to your cardholder or merchant agreements, nor is Apple responsible for the (a) content, accuracy or unavailability of any payment cards, commerce activities, transactions or purchases while using Apple Pay functionality; (b) issuance of credit or assessing eligibility for credit; (c) accrual or redemption of rewards or stored value under a merchant’s program; or (d) funding or reloading of prepaid cards.  For all disputes or questions about payment cards or associated commerce activity, please contact your issuer or the applicable merchant.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>4 Privacy</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><br>
</b>When using Apple Pay to initiate a payment transaction to be completed on a Supported Device, Apple Pay will transfer payment information in an encrypted format between your Mac and your Supported Device to complete your transaction. When using Apple Pay to make a payment transaction on a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, your payment information will be provided in encrypted format to the website as part of that transaction. When adding a card to Apple Pay on a MacBook Pro with built-in Touch ID, information about your device, such as whether certain device settings are enabled and device use patterns (e.g. percent time device is in motion, approximate number of calls per week), will be sent to Apple to determine your eligibility and to prevent fraud. You can find more information on the data collected, used or shared as part of your use of Apple Pay by reading About Apple Pay and Privacy (which can be accessed by going to Wallet &amp; Apple Pay on your iOS device or Mac, or within the Watch app on a paired iOS device).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can learn more about how Apple protects your personal information by reviewing our Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/"><span class="s1">www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/</span></a>. By using Apple Pay, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all of the foregoing information, to provide Apple Pay functionality.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>5 Security</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><br>
</b>Apple Pay stores virtual representations of your Supported Cards, and you understand and acknowledge that providing your device passcode or password to a third party, or allowing a third party to add their fingerprint to use Touch ID on your Supported Device or Mac, may result in their ability to make Apple Pay payments within websites on your Mac.   You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your devices and the applicable passcodes and passwords.  You agree that Apple does not have any responsibility if you lose or share access to your device, or if you make unauthorized modifications to macOS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If your device is lost or stolen and you have Find My iPhone or Find My Mac enabled, you can use Find iPhone or <a href="http://icloud.com">icloud.com</a> to attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Cards on the device by putting it into Lost Mode. You can also erase your device, which will attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Cards on the device. You should also contact the card issuer of your Supported Cards in order to prevent unauthorized access to your virtual Supported Cards.</p>
<p class="p1"><br>
If you report or Apple suspects fraudulent or abusive activity, you agree to cooperate with Apple in any investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>6 Limitation of Liability</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE LICENSE, APPLE DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR PURCHASES, PAYMENTS, TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHER COMMERCE ACTIVITY MADE USING THE APPLE PAY FEATURE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO AGREEMENTS YOU MAY HAVE WITH YOUR CARD ISSUER, PAYMENT NETWORK, OR MERCHANT TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES RELATING TO YOUR SUPPORTED CARDS, VIRTUAL SUPPORTED CARDS AND ASSOCIATED COMMERCE ACTIVITY.</b></p>
